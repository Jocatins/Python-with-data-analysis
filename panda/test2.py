# We will create an additional function group_aggregation which will take a data frame, a group variable, and an aggregation variable.
#  The function will group by the group variable and calculate the mean of the aggregation variable for each group.
# Your function will return the grouped data frame.

import pandas as pd

# Loading dataset


def read_csv():
    # Define the column names as a list
    names = ["mpg", "cylinders", "displacement", "horsepower",
             "weight", "acceleration", "model_year", "origin", "car_name"]
    # Read in the CSV file from the webpage using the defined column names
    df = pd.read_csv("auto-mpg.data", header=None,
                     names=names, delim_whitespace=True)
    return df


df = read_csv()

# Describing data


def group_aggregation(df, group_var, agg_var):
    grouped_df = df.groupby([group_var])[agg_var].mean()

    return grouped_df


# Calling the function
print(group_aggregation(read_csv(), "cylinders", "mpg"))

# df: A dataframe containing the dataset in the form of a matrix.
# group_var: A variable that will group the data
# agg_var: A variable to aggregate or describe the grouped data with statistics

# Line 26 is the most important line. We are using a built-in function groupby()on df which takes one arguments:group_var.
# It will return the data grouped according to group_var column.
# Next, we are calculating the mean of the grouped data with the agg_var column.

# at line 28, we are returning the result.

# At line 32 we are calling the function group_aggregation(read_csv(),"cylinders","mpg")).
# First control will transfer to read_csv() at line 10 and weâ€™ll get a dataframe.

# The next argument is cylinders. According to the dataset we have five different values for cylinders: 3,4,5,6, and 8.

# So the dataframe df will be grouped into five groups, each group represented by a different cylinder count.
# In simple words, all cars having 3 cylinders will form one group. Similarly, all cars having 4 cylinders will form another group, and so on.

# The last argument is mpg. According to the dataset, mpg holds continuous values.
# According to implementation, the mean of mpg for all the cars (of the same group) will be returned and printed.

# According to the result, you will notice:

# The average mpg of cars having 3 cylinders in total is 20.550000.
# The average mpg of cars having 4 cylinders in total is 29.286765.
# The average mpg of cars having 5 cylinders in total is 27.366667.
# The average mpg of cars having 6 cylinders in total is 19.985714.
# The average mpg of cars having 8 cylinders in total is 14.963107.
