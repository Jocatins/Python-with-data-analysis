# Introduction to Analytics

Analytics, at its core, is the process of taking raw data and extracting actionable insights.

For example, a raw data set would be the historical stock market prices and financials for all of the companies in the S&P 500. By itself, that raw data isnâ€™t that useful. With analytical skills, though, you can start to extract understanding from your data. Perhaps, you wish to discover the average market return by year or identify any stocks with outlier performances. Analytics is the process by which you were to understand your data. Moreover, that understanding will allow you to make data-driven decisions.

# The Analytic process

The processes can be broken down into 4 distinct steps

-   Processing the data
-   Describing the data
-   Cleaning the data
-   Visualizing the data

We will be using Python exclusively in this course and will discuss many of its great libraries, such as Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, and Seaborn.

Installation of numpy
