# We use the open() command to read the file. We first pass the name of the file we want to process and then an r which stands for read.
# Since we used the with as functionality in Python, our filehandle is now represented as the variable f and is only relevant within this scope.
# This is good practice for reading files because you donâ€™t have to worry about closing the filehandle.
# Once you have a filehandle, Python makes it very easy to access the lines. The variable f is now an iterable where each iterable is a line of the file.

# for line in f

# We are just looping over the lines of our file.
# The code above only prints out those lines, but since we have direct access to the lines of our file, we can do whatever we want in our processing.
# For example, here is code that takes only the first value of each row and appends them to a list.
