line_plot(read_csv())

# Before plotting, we need to filter out the data we need. Look at line 20.
# Here we are considering all the rows for which the value in car_name would have ford as a substring

# Line 23 is the most important line. We are using a built-in function lineplot() from seaborn library which takes two main argument:

# column1: Column whose values are to plotted at the x-axis
# column2: Column whose values are to plotted at the y-axis

# At line 26, we are calling the function line_plot(read_csv()).
# First control will transfer to read_csv() at line 7 and weâ€™ll get a dataframe. Then control will go to line 17 and plot will be visualized
