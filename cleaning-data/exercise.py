# the outlier_detection(df) function at line 21. It takes one arguments as input:

# Line 22 is the most important line. We are using a built-in function quantile()on df which takes one argument:[.90, .10].
# We are specifying the range for quartile that it should be between 0.90 and 0.10.

# At line 26 we are calling the function outlier_detection(read_csv()). First control will transfer to read_csv() at line 9 and weâ€™ll get a dataframe.
# Then control will go to line 11 and 90th and 10th percentile will be returned for each column.
